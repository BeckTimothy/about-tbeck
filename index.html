		<h2>About Timothy Beck</h2>
		<p>Hey there, I'm Timothy Beck, aka <strong>Macho Man Randy Savage</strong> I'm a 26 year old nerd living in Albuquerque, New Mexico. My ideal evening is spent either learning new things or grinding away at some video games. </p>
		<p>I've been spending the last few months learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript, in hopes to establish a firm footing for this Fullstack Bootcamp I'm participating in. My goal is to establish myself in the programming industry to create technology that betters the world.</p>
		<p>I've put aside my passion hobby of playing video games for the next 10 weeks during my intensive studying. When I play video games, I organize with a community I help run, comprised of 900+ members, we are The Undead Lords, and elitist, chaotic evil faction whose sole purpose is to murder all that oppose us and sacrifice their souls to our god of death, Myrkul, fictionally speaking, of course. In my free time I enjoy wrestling professionally in the guise of my alter ego, "Macho Man Randy Sanchez".</p>
